## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- First time using git with VS code
- I learned how to add icons to page titles
- I also learned how to use custom(local) fonts in css. A snippet is showm
  below:

```css
@fontface {
  font-family: "custom-font-name";
  src: url("custom-font-url");
}
```

### Continued development

- I want to get more accustumed to making responsive pages
- I still want to learn more on using custom fonts, using fonts without having
  to download them.

### Useful resources

- [Using Git with VS code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_23KUAEtUM) - This
  helped me use git with VS code for my first time. I really liked this pattern
  and will use it going forward.
- [How to Add a Custom Font to Your Website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAU25Fo4bFY) -
  This is an amazing video which helped me learn to use custom fonts. I'd
  recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
